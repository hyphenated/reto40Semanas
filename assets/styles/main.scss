/**
 * importer.less
 *
 * By default, new Sails projects are configured to compile this file
 * from LESS to CSS.  Unlike CSS files, LESS files are not compiled and
 * included automatically unless they are imported below.
 *
 * The LESS files imported below are compiled and included in the order
 * they are listed.  Mixins, variables, etc. should be imported first
 * so that they can be accessed by subsequent LESS stylesheets.
 *
 * (Just like the rest of the asset pipeline bundled in Sails, you can
 * always omit, customize, or replace this behavior with SASS, SCSS,
 * or any other Grunt tasks you like.)

// Main stylesheet: just to serve as a hb for all the structure, 
// no styles need to be here, NOTHING AT ALL!
// 
// Naming convention:                                                           
// Variables, functions, mixins names goes all in lowercase and spaced with 
// dash, only use cammel case if there is something result or scripting from 
// javascript.
// 
// Style order:                                                                 
// The order of rules for each style block will be alphabetic ascending, can be 
// done easily with F9 in Sublime Text.
// 
// We should not have more than 6 levels nested selectors just to avoid madness 
// with code mantaining
// 
// Folder structure:
// VENDOR/ is for CSS related to some JavaScript libraries, or some dependencies that does
// not have or need bower to be installed
// MODULES/ is for mixins, variables and utilities (such as icons or sprites).
// PATTERNS/ is for global styles, buttons, inputs, and small groups of styles.
// COMPONENTS/ is for groups of patterns with small bits of layout.
// LAYOUTS/ is where page layouts go and any page-specific changes to patterns
// and components. Just small group of styles to complete patterns and components definition.
